## Admin Interface Enhancements

### Tutorial videos

New banners in Magento's admin system provide access to tutorial videos designed to help a merchant learn the most common and essential admin functions needed to get a store up and running. These include walk-throughs of product and category creation, CMS content management, payment/shipping setup, and other configuration.

If a tutorial video exists for an area of the admin, it will be displayed prominently when visiting that area. You can also view all existing videos at System -> Configuration -> Nucleus Info.
