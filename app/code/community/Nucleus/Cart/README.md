## Ajax Add to Cart

This features makes it as quick and painless as possible for customers to add a product to their cart without disrupting the rest of their shopping experience.

Adding a product to the cart from a category or product detail page does not result in a full page reload or navigate the customer away. Instead, the site mini-cart is activated to give the customer clear feedback as the request is occurring and notify them when the product is successfully added.

### Configuration

Ajax Add to Cart is enabled by default, but it can be disabled in the Magento admin in System -> Configuration -> Checkout -> Ajax Add to Cart.
