Use the banquet fork as a serving piece for guests to pick up slices of roast or turkey to serve themselves. Use the large serving spoon’s wide bowl with side dishes and, for deeper dishes, employ the solid spoon with its extra-long handle.  Each serving utensil features a long, slender handle, allowing the user to easily and safely serve food. The weighted balance provides optimal control and allows each utensil to sit comfortably in the palm of the hand. The Lucerne serving set complements the Lucerne flatware collection, completing this sleek dinner party look. ;https://www.forthechef.com/media/catalog/product/l/u/lucerneservingset.jpg;FortheChef;0030-21, 0030-22, 0030-23, 0030-24, 0030-25;K-996109816;in stock;Jet Serveware, Tabletop > Flatware;1.40 lbs;new;5647;Jet Serveware, Tabletop > Flatware;Greater than 10;
