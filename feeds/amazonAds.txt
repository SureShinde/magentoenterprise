Wooden spoons have many benefits, like being non conductive, so the handle of the spoon will not heat up while stirring boiling or extremely hot dishes. When preparing highly acidic foods or fruits like tomato sauce and lemon curds, metal spoons typically would react to such products and leave a metallic taste, while olâ reliable wooden spoon would not. Ideal for non-stick, glass, and porcelain cookware, lightweight, and comfortable to grip, the wooden spoon is an essential and functional tool of the kitchen.Thereâs many reasons why one should prefer a wooden spoon, but no matter what, this maple wood wooden spoon is a tool that could last you for many years.
